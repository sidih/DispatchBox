{ "title": "Introduction", "text": "This digital textbook aims to provide a step-by step introduction to using parliamentary proceedings as a datasource fit for multidisciplinary research questions. To this end, it specifically uses the ParlaMint corpora – a cluster of 29 corpora containing records of plenary sessions from European parliaments spanning at least the years of 2015 and early 2022. The great advantage of ParlaMint lies in its careful design which allows to respect national particularities while ensuring comparability between single parliaments through a common timeframe and a broad set of shared metadata categories as well as through an addition of machine-translated proceedings to English on top of the original transcripts. This makes ParlaMint not only relevant for individual studies into parliamentary discourse and activity, but also extensively useful for comparable studies that are of growing importance in our interlinked world plagued ever more with hostile political polarisation, populist movements and a loss of shared vision for the future.", "tags": "", "url": "preface_1.html#DispatchBox-p-5" },

The first, theoretical part ( Part I ) introduces the main challenges of working with parliamentary data to equip the user with key information that fosters a critical understanding of the results. It also provides detailed information on ParlaMint corpora. While the sections on parliamentary discourse ( Part I ) and corpus-linguistic methods ( Part II ) are more broadly applicable, the digital textbook devotes substantial attention to explaining the structure and contents of ParlaMint corpora. This focus reflects both the uniqueness of the resource – designed to support multidisciplinary approaches – and the central concern in data reuse: the necessity of thoroughly understanding the corpus to use it appropriately.", "tags": "", "url": "preface_1.html#DispatchBox-p-7" },

With its broad set of languages and a machine-translated version of the proceedings to English, ParlaMint provides a unique resource to boost the presence of less-represented languages and enables large-scale comparative research. This dual potential is illustrated in the digital textbook: Showcase I demonstrates the value of the machine-translated version of the corpus for coarse-grained comparative exploration, while Showcase II provides primarily a more in-depth view into a single original language corpus from an internal comparative perspective. More specifically, Showcase I looks into the gendered dimension of topic preferences in the parliaments across Europe, while Showcase II examines the challenges of applying sentence-level sentiment information to word- and phrase-level concepts, with a focus on exploring longitudinal and party-based variation in parliamentary discourse.", "tags": "", "url": "preface_1.html#DispatchBox-p-8" },

Increasingly, researchers turn to such data as a multidisciplinary treasure trove to explore not only political processes but also a wide spectrum of societal concerns, making parliamentary records valuable to fields such as linguistics, discourse analysis, sociology, history, law, and gender studies. Parliamentary proceedings are particularly noteworthy, as they document the work of elected representatives whose proposals, speeches, and voting behaviour have a direct impact on public life. These records allow scholars to identify and investigate the most salient societal concerns at any given time, while also providing a basis for evaluating and monitoring the performance of Members of Parliament (MPs).", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-11" },
{ "title": "Parliamentary data in Social Sciences and Humanities research", "text": "Although parliamentary proceedings have long served as research material in SSH domains, earlier studies were typically constrained by the limited volume of text that could be processed manually. The emergence of parliamentary corpora has transformed this landscape by making large datasets available (see CLARIN Resource Families ) and by facilitating access to more comprehensive search results through concordancers and other tools that accommodate varying levels of technical expertise. This increased accessibility has expanded the potential of parliamentary corpora for use across a wide range of SSH disciplines and within diverse methodological frameworks. Importantly, parliamentary corpora, such as ParlaMint, are often enriched with multiple layers of annotation and metadata, enabling users to explore complex research questions engaging multiple parameters – for instance, linking linguistic features to sociodemographic information or connecting semantic annotation with patterns of political communication. Tools such as concordancers support mixed-method approaches, allowing scholars to combine distant reading, which reveals overarching patterns, with close reading, which captures fine-grained details crucial to the interpretative work in SSH disciplines.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-12" },

They also provide a basis for exploring how societal and cultural dynamics are articulated and negotiated in political speech. They are particularly well suited to tracing the emergence, evolution, and circulation of concepts and thematic frameworks in political discourse – both across time and across different parliaments.

{ "title": "Source data", "text": "Parliamentary transcripts constitute a rich yet complex source of data, often including varying levels of metadata and considerable diversity in content and format across countries and historical periods. Records of parliamentary activity have long been produced to ensure accountability and continuity, enabling both officials and the public to monitor decisions made within the legislative arena. Given the central role of parliaments in the political structures of most contemporary states, it became customary to maintain written documentation of their proceedings. However, official transcripts of debates were not universally available from the outset. In many contexts, parliamentary debates were initially documented only in abbreviated or paraphrased reports, often compiled by journalists and published in newspapers rather than disseminated by the institution itself. For example, unofficial accounts of the debate held on 16 October 1883 were printed in Slovenec (1873–1945), a newspaper subtitled as political newspaper for the Slovene nation (available through the sPeriodika corpus ).", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-16" },
{ "title": "Source data", "text": "Today, most parliaments provide free access to their official transcripts in response to growing public demands for transparency. However, these transcripts are published in a wide range of formats and hosted on websites with varying structures, which complicates both retrieval and processing. This poses challenges not only for individual researchers but also for compilers of large-scale resources, such as ParlaMint corpora.

{ "title": "Parliamentary proceedings as evidence of parliamentary activity", "text": "Another methodological concern relates to the faithfulness of the transcripts. Official parliamentary proceedings are typically produced according to transcription conventions, which vary across countries and are not always explicitly codified. In most cases, the transcripts aim to convey a faithful record of what was said, but they often omit features of spontaneous speech such as false starts, hesitations, repetitions, or background interjections. As a result, while the text provides a reasonably reliable representation of parliamentary talk, it does not capture every pragmatic nuance of oral delivery (see Voices of Parliament, ch. 4.2 by Fišer & Pahor de Maiti, 2021 ).", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-19" },
{ "title": "Parliamentary proceedings as evidence of parliamentary activity", "text": "The availability of written transcripts may also create the impression that parliamentary discourse is a purely textual phenomenon, when in fact it is inherently multimodal. Parliamentary speech is delivered live before multiple audiences: fellow MPs, institutional actors such as clerks and presiding officers, the media, and, indirectly, the electorate. Its effectiveness is therefore shaped not only by what is said, but also by how it is said, how it is received, and how it is mediated. Elements such as intonation, gesture, irony, sarcasm, or audience reactions may significantly affect the meaning of an utterance but are generally lost in the textual record. Researchers must therefore carefully consider whether their research questions can be adequately answered on the basis of written transcripts alone, or whether access to audio-visual recordings is necessary. For the purposes of this digital textbook, we focus on use cases that can be reliably addressed with textual data alone. It is worth noting, however, that new initiatives, like ParlaSpeech , have emerged that seek to fill this gap by aligning speech signals with their corresponding transcripts. Such developments hold considerable promise for future research, particularly for scholars interested in the pragmatics and performative dimensions of parliamentary discourse.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-20" },

{ "title": "The comparative perspective", "text": "Parliamentary proceedings form part of a broader genre of political discourse, which also includes speeches delivered outside parliament, such as campaign addresses or MPs’ posts on social media. Within this larger sphere, parliamentary discourse itself constitutes a distinct subgenre, and, as noted earlier, it further divides into several internal subgenres. Illie (2015) identifies some of the more representative ones, which are typical of Westminster-system parliaments: ministerial statements, interpellations, parliamentary speeches, parliamentary debates, oral and written parliamentary questions, and question time. Each of these fulfils different institutional goals and follows specific rules of interaction. For instance, an interpellation is a formal procedure designed to question the government about its actions, while a parliamentary speech typically presents a party's or individual's position. Because of their divergent purposes and conventions, these subgenres are not directly comparable in linguistic terms. For example, the pragmatic weight of a question asked during question time differs considerably from that of a statement in a plenary speech, even if both are formally part of parliamentary discourse.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-22" },
{ "title": "The comparative perspective", "text": "Beyond internal variation, comparative research also needs to account for the differences produced by parliamentary culture across national contexts and historical periods. Parliamentary culture encompasses the traditions, norms, behaviours, and institutional practices that shape how parliaments are formed and how they function. It reflects a complex interplay between formal rules – such as procedures, debate structures, or turn-taking conventions – and informal customs, including rhetorical styles, patterns of interaction, or the expectations associated with particular roles. These practices are influenced not only by internal dynamics but also by broader social forces, such as public opinion and media attention.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-23" },
{ "title": "The comparative perspective", "text": "It is important to recognise parliaments as highly conventionalised communicative settings. Institutional procedures affect almost every aspect of discourse, from the structure and content of debate to forms of address, the use of set phrases, and the preferred style of deliberation, e.g., free interventions versus pre-prepared speeches, admissibility of interruptions). Such conventions differ across parliaments, though certain overlaps can be observed among those with shared traditions. In fact, sociohistorical developments and cultural traditions exert a strong influence on debating styles. A broad, if somewhat simplified, distinction can be drawn between Westminster-type parliaments, where debate tends to be adversarial and confrontational, and Western European consensus-oriented parliaments, which promote a more deliberative and cooperative style. Comparative research must remain attentive to such differences: what appears as a dominant rhetorical strategy in one context may be exceptional in another, and methods must be adapted accordingly.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-24" },
{ "title": "The comparative perspective", "text": "Awareness of both national specificity and cross-national similarity is therefore essential in comparative studies of parliamentary discourse, but it is equally important to understand that research design is constrained by the affordances of the available corpus data: each national ParlaMint corpus covers a different timespan, provides varying levels of speaker metadata, and may differ in the annotation of socio-demographic information (such as the presence or absence of speaker birthdates). While ParlaMint is unique in its aim to maximise comparability across languages and contexts, the scope of information ultimately depends on what is provided by the individual parliamentary institutions. These differences directly shape which metadata could be incorporated into the final corpus and, consequently, which metadata categories can meaningfully serve as parameters in cross-parliamentary comparative studies.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-25" },

For this reason, it was decided to add data from Wikipedia pages (and in very rare cases, also annotations produced by corpus compilers) as the second layer of the annotation of political orientation. Since the CHES database contains numerical representations of political orientation and there was no objective way to pair those with the categorial values used in Wikipedia, it was decided that only Wikipedia values will be represented in noSketch Engine . For the moment (September 2025), noSketch Engine exhibits some speeches being labelled with multiple values (see here , for example, the label Centre;Centre-right). Such speeches belong to speakers who themselves are tagged as belonging to multiple parties (e.g., Tomenko, Mykola Volodymyrovyč – Batkivshchyna;BPP). This is linked either to data processing errors or to 1-day overlaps between parties when the person switched their affiliation. Their particularity lies in the fact that these are fixed values collected from Wikipedia in 2022 and therefore do not capture the potentially shifting political orientations of parties over time, as the CHES dataset does. Moreover, the fact that the values were collected in 2022 does not imply that they represent the parties’ orientations in that specific year (some parties had already been dissolved by then), but simply that the information was harvested at that time.

{ "title": "Semantic annotation", "text": "Semantic annotations are only available for the machine-translated English version of ParlaMint , while topic annotations are provided for all ParlaMint corpora (both for corpora in the original language and for their translated versions). Semantic tagging is applied at the word level and could thus be considered actually part of the linguistic annotation layer, whereas topic annotation is applied at the speech level. The two annotation layers differ in their schemas. Semantic tagging relies on the USAS taxonomy , which comprises 21 broad domains of human experience and knowledge (Figure 30), while topic annotation is based on the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema, which is specifically designed to classify policy agendas and parliamentary topics (Figure 23). Although both annotations are automatic and rely on manually created knowledge, they use different generations of computational models. Semantic tagging is performed with pymusas (Python Multilingual UCREL Semantic Analysis System) , a rule-based tagger that combines lexicon lookups with spaCy components for tokenisation and handling of multiword expressions. Topic annotation, on the other hand, is performed with a large multilingual transformer model. Specifically, it uses the XLM-R-Parla model, a BERT-like model that has been additionally pre-trained on parliamentary proceedings. The speeches were then automatically classified into CAP categories using the GPT-4o model (see Section Topic information ).", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-list-10" },

Instead, the two layers should be seen as complementary. Semantic tagging provides a bottom-up perspective on how words are used (tags are assigned at the word level), making it particularly valuable for linguistic and discourse analysis. By contrast, topic annotation offers a top-down perspective on what debates are about (tags are assigned at the speech level), which is more suitable for political science research and related fields.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-108" },
{ "title": "Semantic annotation", "text": "Together, they enable researchers to study not only what parliaments talk about, but also how they talk about it. For instance, semantic annotations can be used to analyse the use of emotional language across debates or to track how economic vocabulary is distributed over time and across the topics identified by the topic-annotation layer. This, in turn, allows us to understand how much parliamentary attention is devoted to areas such as healthcare or infrastructure, for example. Semantic tags also make it possible to compare rhetorical styles, e.g., whether debates rely more on emotional or technical vocabulary, to measure shifts in framing, e.g., whether migration is discussed in terms of economy or security, and to conduct cross-national comparisons, e.g., whether different parliaments emphasise similar or different semantic domains when addressing the same policy issue.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-109" },

{ "title": "Some considerations", "text": "The Section on Corpus provenance, structure and annotation provided an overview of the rich annotations included in ParlaMint. We saw the diversity of information layered on top of the original transcripts, and the comparability not only of the underlying data but also of the added annotation layers. It is crucial to understand that data annotation produces more than just descriptive labels. Instead, they are powerful research tools that allow scholars to delimit searches, contextualise results, and refine analyses in ways that directly shape findings. For example, excluding chairpersons may be essential when investigating the framing of topical issues, since their contributions often concern procedural matters; if the metadata identifying chairpersons are absent, such a filter becomes impossible and the results risk being skewed. All of this greatly extends the value of ParlaMint as a data resource suitable for a wide range of research questions – both within a single parliament and for comparative work. However, when working with any part of the corpus – whether original transcripts, translations, metadata, or linguistic annotations – several considerations need to be kept in mind. Issues specific to the original texts have already been discussed in Section Working with Parliamentary Corpora ; the following paragraphs focus instead on considerations related to machine translations and annotations.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-111" },
{ "title": "Some considerations", "text": "When using the machine-translated versions of ParlaMint, researchers should be aware that these texts are designed primarily to enable comparability across corpora rather than to provide perfect linguistic fidelity. Machine translation may smooth over idiomatic expressions, rhetorical nuance, or culturally specific references, which can affect analyses that depend on fine-grained linguistic detail (for some examples see Erjavec et al.). Semantic annotations are only available for the translated corpora, which makes them valuable but also means that any potential translation errors can propagate into the annotation layer. It is therefore important that researchers explicitly acknowledge the use of machine-translated data in their analyses and, where appropriate, cross-check findings against the original texts, which are easily accessible in noSketch Engine (see Section Analysing the keywords on health ). In this way, the translations are most reliable for large-scale, comparative analyses of meaning, but should be used with caution in studies requiring close linguistic or stylistic interpretation.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-112" },
{ "title": "Some considerations", "text": "Regarding the metadata, despite extensive efforts to produce comparable corpora, limitations in available data and national political traditions mean that some metadata fields may be systematically missing or inconsistently populated – for instance, the birth-year field is empty in ParlaMint-GB, but not in ParlaMint-SI. It is therefore essential to check each corpus you plan to use before you finalise your study plan: what is present, what is missing, and how evenly fields are populated.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-113" },
{ "title": "Some considerations", "text": "Moreover, any annotation campaign requires decisions about logistical setup (e.g., number of annotators, annotations per item, annotator training) and the annotation schema. The schema substantially influences outcomes and the usefulness of the annotations for different user communities. No taxonomy will be ideal for all research questions. By understanding both the procedure and the schema used, it becomes easier to leverage the considerable work already invested in annotation and to find ways to reuse or adapt the data for one’s purposes.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-114" },
{ "title": "Some considerations", "text": "In ParlaMint, metadata categories follow shared taxonomies designed to reflect available source data and ensure comparability across corpora – one of the collection’s main advantages. This does not mean they should be accepted uncritically or applied uniformly across studies, nor discarded at the first sign of mismatch with the framework the researcher has in mind. For some projects, categories, used in ParlaMint, may be too broad to capture important distinctions, for others, too narrow. In such cases, it is advisable to treat the annotations as a starting point: to help filter the data, to be used for triangulation with other annotations, to reinterpret them in light of a selected analytical framework. It is always possible to set them aside altogether and focus just on the original texts. A case in point are political orientation metadata: the broad categories used in ParlaMint may not capture the nuances required for fine-grained studies of the far right in political science, yet they remain valuable for more broadly designed analyses of party landscape or as the first data filter. The key is to approach metadata critically and reflexively, in connection with the adopted research questions and theoretical assumptions.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-115" },
{ "title": "Some considerations", "text": "Finally, it is important to understand how the metadata and annotations were produced . Sociodemographic information in ParlaMint was typically drawn from official parliamentary records and can generally be trusted, aside from occasional clerical errors. In other cases, such as political orientation, expert sources or triangulated records were used to fill gaps. In other cases, automatic models trained and/or evaluated on expert annotations, such as those used for sentiment and topic annotation, were applied to generate high-confidence predictions. Each of these methods carries implications for reliability and for the kinds of questions that can be answered with the available tags. Inevitably, some errors persist, whether due to inaccuracies in source data, misclassifications by predictive models, or processing issues. Although multiple mitigation measures were implemented in ParlaMint, like systematic error checking and the use of high-accuracy models, no dataset is error-free, but rather than dismissing the metadata, researchers should just approach them with due vigilance and try making the most out of the data.", "tags": "", "url": "ch01.html#DispatchBox-p-116" },

Consider, for example, the first two topics in the listing above (Figure 40) that are shared between the two subcorpora: Health and Macroeconomics . In absolute terms, Health is more frequently represented in the regularMP_M subcorpus than in regularMP_F (50 million tokens vs. 32 million tokens, respectively). This might lead to a quick but misleading conclusion that health is a more dominant topic for men than for women. However, relative frequencies reveal the opposite: women address health almost twice as often as men. By contrast, Macroeconomics is clearly very prominent in the regularMP_M subcorpus and much less so in regularMP_F . Relative frequencies confirm this trend, showing that macroeconomic issues are discussed nearly 1.5 times more often in men’s speeches. Yet the absolute counts also show that, despite this difference, Macroeconomics remains a major theme in the regularMP_F subcorpus, ranking second overall.", "tags": "", "url": "ch02.html#DispatchBox-p-149" },

In the lower part of the page, we see the list of topics which are followed by frequency information and three dots which leads us to concordance lines (Figure 41). Figure 41. Display the concordance lines of regularMP_F for the topic of Health. We are redirected to the Concordance view which allows interacting with the data, i.e., the actual transcripts of speeches. In the upper right corner, we see a + symbol which is used to create a subcorpus from all the listed concordance lines (Figure 42). However, due to a limitation of the tool which does not allow creating a subcorpus based on concordance lines that were computed based on another user-defined subcorpus (in our case regularMP_F ), we need to re-display the desired concordances through the search functionality or the so-called Concordance function. Figure 42. The deactivated + symbol otherwise used to create a subcorpus from concordance lines. noSketch Engine enables different types of searches, from simple to advanced. The interface allows to formulate search queries that combine tokens, different levels of linguistic tags and metadata. The search option that allows most complex queries is called CQL which uses a particular syntax and requires a bit of getting-used-to. To learn the syntax, please head to this link: https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/corpus-querying/ However, there are some shortcuts in noSketch Engine that help the user formulate the CQL query, like the CQL builder available in the interface, or reusing previous queries displayed in the tool which is what we will do in our case. In the list of concordances, look at the upper left corner where you’ll find the CQL query used to display the concordance lines on the topic of Health (Figure 43). Copy this to your clipboard, i.e., <speech topic==Health>[]. Figure 43. CQL query information on the Concordance page. As shown in Figure 44, open the Concordance function via the menu on the left, choose the Advanced tab and the CQL option in the list.

At first glance, the keyword lists (for health_F and for health_M ) appear rather confusing, which requires some preliminary clarification before moving on to interpretation. The lists can be more or less “messy.” This is especially true for the machine-translated version, which contains typical translation errors (see Footnote 5 ). The keyword method itself also adds to this messiness, as it tends to highlight anomalies or features that are particularly distinctive compared to the reference subcorpus. Another layer of complexity in interpreting these lists is the importance of context: while a researcher is usually familiar with the political and social background of the country they are analysing, it is much harder to remain fully aware of all the local political issues, debates, and actors that may surface in the keywords of several parliaments, as is our case. By contrast, keyword lists derived from original-language data are usually much clearer. For instance, see the two keyword lists from the British corpus in Figure 53 below. Figure 53. An example of the analysis of keywords from speeches on health delivered by men and women MPs from the ParlaMint-GB corpus. Although the lists we obtain are less straightforward to interpret than those derived directly from the ParlaMint corpora in the original languages (due to translation errors and limited contextual information) they can still be analytically useful if approached with appropriate mitigation strategies. Such strategies may include disregarding obvious translation mistakes or restricting the analysis to common nouns only. To minimise the analytical challenges posed by insufficient knowledge of the local context across 29 parliaments, and to facilitate content analysis aimed at subtopic identification, we adopt the latter strategy and exclude proper nouns from our analysis. One way to achieve this is to disregard all lemmas that begin with or are written entirely in capital letters. While this could be done manually, we make use of a shortcut available in noSketch Engine: To generate a list of keywords that reflects only common nouns – operationalised here as words written in lowercase, we repeat Action 5 ( Change criteria ) and introduce one additional parameter under Keywords settings . Specifically, we add a filter under Matching regex in the following format: [a-z].* (Figure 54). Figure 54. Add regular expression (regex) to exclude proper nouns.

Compare the retrieved relative frequencies on mentions of Europe (Figure 73) with those of the European Union (Figure 72) across the two periods.

Do you observe any other similarities or discrepancies in the relative frequency patterns under analysis before and after Brexit? Figure 73. Relative frequency of uses of Europe before and after Brexit in ParlaMint-GB. ➽ noSketch Engine tip: because relative frequency and relative density represent different aspects of distribution, they should not be combined or interpreted as if they were directly comparable. As a reminder, relative frequency expresses how often an item occurs in relation to the size of a given text type or subcorpus, whereas relative density shows how frequent a word or phrase is in a particular text type compared with its frequency in the whole corpus, taking into account the size of that text type. It therefore indicates how typical or characteristic the item is of that text type. Since these measures capture distinct dimensions of usage, students must keep them analytically separate and avoid drawing conclusions by comparing one measure from one subcorpus with the other measure from another. Compare the retrieved relative density of mentions of the European Union (Figure 74) across the two periods. Remember that sentiment is annotated at the sentence level, and a sentence labelled as “Negative”, “Neutral”, or “Positive” does not necessarily express a negative, neutral, or positive stance toward the EU itself, although it is mentioned in those sentences. However, you can make some preliminary observations about more typical or less typical sentiment contexts for mentions of the European Union before and after Brexit.

{ "title": "Glossary", "text": "Annotation is the process of adding interpretative linguistic or extralinguistic information to a corpus. Collocation is a relationship of co-occurrence between a search word or phrase (a node) and those words, which appear together with it more often than would be expected by chance. Concordance is a machine-generated display of all occurrences of a search unit in a corpus, shown with surrounding context for each instance. Concordance line is a text snippet extracted from a corpus that displays a search word or phrase (the node) together with a limited amount of its surrounding context. Concordancer is a software program that generates concordances from a machine-readable collection of texts (a corpus) and is commonly equipped with additional analytical functions. Corpus Query Language (CQL) is a system of instructions used for searches in a corpus, allowing queries based on words, lemmas, tags, attributes, text types, structures, and conditions. Regular expressions can be used in CQL to match specific values. Frequency list is a list of all items of a given type in a corpus (e.g., words, tags or values of a metadata category in focus) with counts of their occurrences. Key Word in Context (KWIC) is a concordance format where the search term is centred, with preceding and following context shown in side columns. Keyword is a word that occurs significantly more often in the focus corpus than in some reference corpus . Lemma is an abstract unit expressed by the base wordform (headword in a dictionary) that encompasses all the inflected and suppletive forms of the same base word. For instance, go, goes, going, went and gone are the wordforms of the lemma go . Lemmatisation is the process of assigning each token in the corpus to its lemma with the help of a tool called a lemmatiser. Named entity is a word or phrase that identifies a specific real-world object. Most often, it includes the categories of a person, organisation, location and other named objects (like document names). In corpus linguistics and natural language processing, named entities are determined via a procedure called NER – named entity recognition . It refers to the automatic identification and classification of such expressions in text, e.g., recognising “United Nations” as an organisation or “Paris” as a location. Normalisation, or frequency normalisation, is the process of adjusting raw counts to make them comparable across subcorpora of different sizes, typically by converting them into relative frequencies. Other types or normalisation also exist, like text normalisation, which refers to ascribing the canonical (standardised) form of a word to its various spoken or written variants in a corpus. Relative density is a measure that compares how frequent an item is in a specific text type relative to its frequency in the whole corpus, adjusted for the size of that text type. Values below 100% indicate that the item is less typical of that text type; values around 100% indicate equal typicality; and values above 100% indicate that the item is more typical or characteristic of that text type. Relative frequency is the number of tokens of a given item divided by the total number of tokens in a corpus or a subcorpus, multiplied by a constant (e.g., 1,000,000) to express results on a common scale. Statistical measure is any calculated statistic in a corpus that has to do with word frequency and can range from relatively simple metrics to complex models. Collocation, or association, measures, such as t-score, mutual information (MI), log likelihood (LL), log Dice, etc., calculate the strength of association between words in a collocation. Keyword measures , such as log likelihood (LL) or simple maths parameter (SMP), are used to identify words that occur significantly more often in one corpus than in another. Dispersion measures , such as standard deviation or the coefficient of variation, are used to calculate the distribution of words or phrases throughout the corpus (see, e.g., Brezina, 2018 for more details on statistics in corpus linguistics). Token is the smallest unit in a corpus, which can be a wordform, a punctuation mark or a digit.", "tags": "", "url": "glossary.html#gloss" },
