               introduction to using parliamentary proceedings as a datasource fit for
               multidisciplinary research questions. To this end, it specifically uses the ParlaMint
               corpora – a cluster of 29 corpora containing records of plenary sessions from

               with hostile political polarisation, populist movements and a loss of shared vision
               for the future.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-6">The digital textbook is specifically targeted at SSH
               researchers unfamiliar with using computer-assisted discourse analysis and corpus
               linguistic methods. While the sheer amount of data in ParlaMint and the methods
               presented in this digital textbook require the use of a computer, no special
               technical competences are required to follow the digital textbook. All data and tools
               are open access and can be used free of charge. Specifically, the digital textbook
               covers the contents and use of the ParlaMint corpora in the noSketch Engine and
               TEITOK tools.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-7">The digital textbook is divided into two parts. The first,
               theoretical part (<ref target="#ch01">Part I</ref>) introduces the main challenges of
               working with parliamentary data to equip the user with key information that fosters a
               critical understanding of the results. It also provides detailed information on
               ParlaMint corpora. While the sections on parliamentary discourse (<ref target="#ch01">Part I</ref>) and corpus-linguistic methods (<ref target="#ch02">Part II</ref>)
               are more broadly applicable, the digital textbook devotes substantial attention to
               explaining the structure and contents of ParlaMint corpora. This focus reflects both
               the uniqueness of the resource – designed to support multidisciplinary approaches –
               and the central concern in data reuse: the necessity of thoroughly understanding the
               corpus to use it appropriately.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-8">The second, practical part (<ref target="#ch02">Part
                  II</ref>) illustrates the potential and issues related to specific research
               methods through two concrete examples of use. These are used to showcase the
               application of main corpuslinguistic methods coupled with discourse analysis to
               answer concrete research questions. With its broad set of languages and a
               machine-translated version of the proceedings to English, ParlaMint provides a unique
               resource to boost the presence of less-represented languages and enables large-scale
               comparative research. This dual potential is illustrated in the digital textbook:
                  <ref target="#ch02.2">Showcase I</ref> demonstrates the value of the
               machine-translated version of the corpus for coarse-grained comparative exploration,
               while <ref target="#ch02.3">Showcase II</ref> provides primarily a more in-depth view
               into a single original language corpus from an internal comparative perspective. More
               specifically, <ref target="#ch02.2">Showcase I</ref> looks into the gendered
               dimension of topic preferences in the parliaments across Europe, while <ref target="#ch02.3">Showcase II</ref> examines the challenges of applying
               sentence-level sentiment information to word- and phrase-level concepts, with a focus
               on exploring longitudinal and party-based variation in parliamentary discourse.</p>

               <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-11">The active use of parliamentary data constitutes an
                  important approach to advancing knowledge within the Social Sciences and
                  Humanities (SSH). Increasingly, researchers turn to such data as a
                  multidisciplinary treasure trove to explore not only political processes but also
                  a wide spectrum of societal concerns, making parliamentary records valuable to
                  fields such as linguistics, discourse analysis, sociology, history, law, and
                  gender studies. Parliamentary proceedings are particularly noteworthy, as they
                  document the work of elected representatives whose proposals, speeches, and voting
                  behaviour have a direct impact on public life. These records allow scholars to
                  identify and investigate the most salient societal concerns at any given time,
                  while also providing a basis for evaluating and monitoring the performance of
                  Members of Parliament (MPs).</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-12">Although parliamentary proceedings have long served as
                  research material in SSH domains, earlier studies were typically constrained by
                  the limited volume of text that could be processed manually. The emergence of
                  parliamentary corpora has transformed this landscape by making large datasets
                  available (see <ref target="https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families">CLARIN
                     Resource Families</ref>) and by facilitating access to more comprehensive
                  search results through <ref target="#Concordancer">concordancers</ref> and other
                  tools that accommodate varying levels of technical expertise. This increased
                  accessibility has expanded the potential of parliamentary corpora for use across a
                  wide range of SSH disciplines and within diverse methodological frameworks.
                  Importantly, parliamentary corpora, such as ParlaMint, are often enriched with
                  multiple layers of <ref target="#Annotation">annotation</ref> and metadata,
                  enabling users to explore complex research questions engaging multiple parameters
                  – for instance, linking linguistic features to sociodemographic information or
                  connecting semantic annotation with patterns of political communication. Tools
                  such as concordancers support mixed-method approaches, allowing scholars to
                  combine distant reading, which reveals overarching patterns, with close reading,
                  which captures fine-grained details crucial to the interpretative work in SSH
                  disciplines.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-13">Accordingly, parliamentary corpora offer a versatile
                  foundation for a range of research objectives. They enable the examination of
                  specific linguistic phenomena characteristic of parliamentary discourse, while
                  also opening up avenues for analysing broader aspects of politics and society. For
                  example, such corpora support in-depth studies of policy-making processes,
                  parliamentary culture, and political agendas. They also provide a basis for
                  exploring how societal and cultural dynamics are articulated and negotiated in
                  political speech. They are particularly well suited to tracing the emergence,
                  evolution, and circulation of concepts and thematic frameworks in political
                  discourse – both across time and across different parliaments. In addition, they
                  furnish valuable material for uncovering communication strategies and deliberation
                  techniques, shedding light on how parliamentary discourse both mirrors and
                  actively shapes the social world. </p>

               <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-15">Analysing parliamentary discourse requires careful
                  attention to the nature of the source material, contextual factors – such as
                  formal and informal rules of debate, speaker position and affiliation, audience
                  dynamics, and speech topical framing – as well as the interpretative frameworks
                  applied. In this chapter, we look into three foundational aspects that underpin
                  the study of parliamentary discourse: the use of parliamentary transcripts as
                  linguistic data and metadata, the interpretation of parliamentary proceedings as
                  evidence of institutional activity, and the value of a comparative perspective for
                  identifying patterns across time, parliaments and political systems. By situating
                  speeches within their political and institutional environments and reflecting on
                  the nature of the data itself, researchers can avoid reductive conclusions and
                  more fully harness the analytical potential of parliamentary corpora for SSH
                  research.</p>

                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-16">Parliamentary transcripts constitute a rich yet
                     complex source of data, often including varying levels of metadata and
                     considerable diversity in content and format across countries and historical
                     periods. Records of parliamentary activity have long been produced to ensure
                     accountability and continuity, enabling both officials and the public to
                     monitor decisions made within the legislative arena. Given the central role of
                     parliaments in the political structures of most contemporary states, it became
                     customary to maintain written documentation of their proceedings. However,
                     official transcripts of debates were not universally available from the outset.
                     In many contexts, parliamentary debates were initially documented only in
                     abbreviated or paraphrased reports, often compiled by journalists and published
                     in newspapers rather than disseminated by the institution itself. For example,
                     unofficial accounts of the debate held <ref target="https://nl.ijs.si/inz/speriodika/ZC8C8JEM-0.jpg">on 16 October

                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-17">Today, most parliaments provide free access to their
                     official transcripts in response to growing public demands for transparency.
                     However, these transcripts are published in a wide range of formats and hosted
                     on websites with varying structures, which complicates both retrieval and
                     processing. This poses challenges not only for individual researchers but also
                     for compilers of large-scale resources, such as ParlaMint corpora. In light of
                     these challenges, it is often more practical for researchers to incorporate
                     already existing, high-quality data resources into their work rather than
                     undertaking the laborious task of sourcing and standardising raw materials
                     themselves.</p>

                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-19">Another methodological concern relates to the
                     faithfulness of the transcripts. Official parliamentary proceedings are
                     typically produced according to transcription conventions, which vary across
                     countries and are not always explicitly codified. In most cases, the
                     transcripts aim to convey a faithful record of what was said, but they often
                     omit features of spontaneous speech such as false starts, hesitations,
                     repetitions, or background interjections. As a result, while the text provides
                     a reasonably reliable representation of parliamentary talk, it does not capture
                     every pragmatic nuance of oral delivery (see <ref target="https://sidih.github.io/voices/ch4.html#ch4.2.">Voices of
                        Parliament, ch. 4.2</ref> by <ref target="#Fiser_2021">Fišer &amp; Pahor de Maiti, 2021</ref>).</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-20">The availability of written transcripts may also
                     create the impression that parliamentary discourse is a purely textual
                     phenomenon, when in fact it is inherently multimodal. Parliamentary speech is
                     delivered live before multiple audiences: fellow MPs, institutional actors such
                     as clerks and presiding officers, the media, and, indirectly, the electorate.
                     Its effectiveness is therefore shaped not only by what is said, but also by how
                     it is said, how it is received, and how it is mediated. Elements such as
                     intonation, gesture, irony, sarcasm, or audience reactions may significantly
                     affect the meaning of an utterance but are generally lost in the textual
                     record. Researchers must therefore carefully consider whether their research
                     questions can be adequately answered on the basis of written transcripts alone,
                     or whether access to audio-visual recordings is necessary. For the purposes of
                     this digital textbook, we focus on use cases that can be reliably addressed
                     with textual data alone. It is worth noting, however, that new initiatives,
                     like <ref target="https://clarinsi.github.io/parlaspeech/">ParlaSpeech</ref>,
                     have emerged that seek to fill this gap by aligning speech signals with their
                     corresponding transcripts. Such developments hold considerable promise for
                     future research, particularly for scholars interested in the pragmatics and
                     performative dimensions of parliamentary discourse.</p>

                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-22">Parliamentary proceedings form part of a broader
                     genre of political discourse, which also includes speeches delivered outside
                     parliament, such as campaign addresses or MPs’ posts on social media. Within
                     this larger sphere, parliamentary discourse itself constitutes a distinct
                     subgenre, and, as noted earlier, it further divides into several internal
                     subgenres. <ref target="#Ilie_2015">Illie (2015)</ref> identifies some of the more representative ones, which
                     are typical of Westminster-system parliaments: ministerial statements,
                     interpellations, parliamentary speeches, parliamentary debates, oral and
                     written parliamentary questions, and question time. Each of these fulfils
                     different institutional goals and follows specific rules of interaction. For
                     instance, an interpellation is a formal procedure designed to question the
                     government about its actions, while a parliamentary speech typically presents a
                     party's or individual's position. Because of their divergent purposes and
                     conventions, these subgenres are not directly comparable in linguistic terms.
                     For example, the pragmatic weight of a question asked during question time
                     differs considerably from that of a statement in a plenary speech, even if both
                     are formally part of parliamentary discourse.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-23">Beyond internal variation, comparative research also
                     needs to account for the differences produced by parliamentary culture across
                     national contexts and historical periods. Parliamentary culture encompasses the
                     traditions, norms, behaviours, and institutional practices that shape how
                     parliaments are formed and how they function. It reflects a complex interplay
                     between formal rules – such as procedures, debate structures, or turn-taking
                     conventions – and informal customs, including rhetorical styles, patterns of
                     interaction, or the expectations associated with particular roles. These
                     practices are influenced not only by internal dynamics but also by broader
                     social forces, such as public opinion and media attention.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-24">It is important to recognise parliaments as highly
                     conventionalised communicative settings. Institutional procedures affect almost
                     every aspect of discourse, from the structure and content of debate to forms of
                     address, the use of set phrases, and the preferred style of deliberation, e.g.,
                     free interventions versus pre-prepared speeches, admissibility of
                     interruptions). Such conventions differ across parliaments, though certain
                     overlaps can be observed among those with shared traditions. In fact,
                     sociohistorical developments and cultural traditions exert a strong influence
                     on debating styles. A broad, if somewhat simplified, distinction can be drawn
                     between Westminster-type parliaments, where debate tends to be adversarial and
                     confrontational, and Western European consensus-oriented parliaments, which
                     promote a more deliberative and cooperative style. Comparative research must
                     remain attentive to such differences: what appears as a dominant rhetorical
                     strategy in one context may be exceptional in another, and methods must be
                     adapted accordingly.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-25">Awareness of both national specificity and
                     cross-national similarity is therefore essential in comparative studies of
                     parliamentary discourse, but it is equally important to understand that
                     research design is constrained by the affordances of the available corpus data:
                     each national ParlaMint corpus covers a different timespan, provides varying
                     levels of speaker metadata, and may differ in the annotation of
                     socio-demographic information (such as the presence or absence of speaker
                     birthdates). While ParlaMint is unique in its aim to maximise comparability
                     across languages and contexts, the scope of information ultimately depends on
                     what is provided by the individual parliamentary institutions. These
                     differences directly shape which metadata could be incorporated into the final
                     corpus and, consequently, which metadata categories can meaningfully serve as
                     parameters in cross-parliamentary comparative studies.</p>

                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-31">Building on the breadth of geographical coverage of
                     the ParlaMint II corpora (Figure 2), the <ref target="https://clarinsi.github.io/parlacap/">ParlaCAP project</ref> applies
                     advanced natural language processing (NLP) to track political agendas and
                     sentiments across parliamentary proceedings in the ParlaMint dataset. To do so,
                     it engages the <ref target="https://www.comparativeagendas.net/">Comparative
                        Agendas Project</ref>’s coding scheme based on a Master Codebook developed
                     to harmonise a network of projects aiming to classify political agendas
                     according to the policies they address (<ref target="#Bevan_2019">Bevan, 2019</ref>) using a set of 21 topics,
                     e.g. Energy, Defence, Culture, Civil Rights and so on. For more detail, see
                        <ref target="#ch01.4.2.13">Topic Information</ref> below. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-32">Moreover, under the ParlaCAP project, ParlaMint
                     corpora are annotated for sentiment analysis via the ParlaSent deep learning
                     model for multilingual sentiment analysis, which is built on XLM-R-parla, a
                     domain-specific transformer based on XLM-Ro-BERTa-large “vanilla” model, and
                     pre-trained on the parliamentary data (<ref target="#Mochtak_2024">Mochtak et al., 2024</ref>). For more detail,

                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-33">The ParlaCAP project is set to produce a structured,
                     tabular dataset cross-referenced with the PartyFacts metadatabase on political
                     party metadata and, where available, the V-DEM surveys on the state of
                     democracies. This dataset will be made fully downloadable via CESSDA ERIC and
                     accessible through major research infrastructures (CESSDA, CLARIN, and DARIAH),
                     complemented by a graphical user interface and API to ensure broad
                     usability.</p>

                     <ref target="https://clarinsi.github.io/parlaspeech/">ParlaSpeech</ref> is
                     another important initiative that grew directly out of the ParlaMint project.
                     While ParlaMint focuses on text, ParlaSpeech extends this work by aligning
                     transcripts with audio recordings of parliamentary sessions, thereby creating
                     valuable speech–text datasets for under-resourced languages (Ljubešić et al.,
                        <ref target="#Ljubesic_2025">2025</ref>). </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-35">To date, the project contains parliamentary audio
                     recordings in Czech, Polish, Croatian and Serbian. This selection of recordings
                     responds to the uneven availability of speech resources across languages: a
                     handful are well covered, some moderately, while many – including official EU
                     languages – remain in the “long tail” with little to no data. For example,
                     Polish has about 180 hours of public data, Serbian 12, and Croatian had none
                     before ParlaSpeech. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-36">ParlaSpeech incorporates five distinct annotation
                     layers: linguistic annotations (ParlaSpeech-Ling following Universal
                     Dependencies), sentiment annotation (ParlaSpeech-Senti), filled pause
                     identification (ParlaSpeech-Pause), precise word-level alignments
                     (ParlaSpeech-Align), and primary stress markers (ParlaSpeech-Stress), although
                     currently only linguistic, sentiment, and pause annotations are consistently
                     applied to all the datasets in the project. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-37">These layered annotations are designed to support
                     in-depth investigations into prosodic features, patterns of speech disfluency,
                     and comprehensive multimodal analysis of parliamentary discourse. The corpus
                     supports computational (JSONL), phonetic (TextGrid) and corpus linguistic
                     (noSketch Engine) analysis formats.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-38">Key challenges identified include incomplete or
                     inaccurate transcripts, missing or unreleased recordings, inconsistent
                     metadata, and mismatched ordering between transcripts and audio, but the
                     approach shows promise for expanding to many more languages.</p>

                  30 different languages between 2015 and mid-2022. Several national ParlaMint
                  corpora, however, contain data spanning a much longer period. The ParlaMint

                  the amount of data available for a particular national corpus (see Figure 3). For
                  instance, the Slovenian National Assembly consists of 91 MPs versus the French

                              translation errors. The errors can be on the word level, such as very
                              frequent incorrect translations of proper nouns (e.g., The Winner of
                              the Welcomes instead of Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti, the name of a
                              Slovenian politician) or incorrect translation of terms (e.g., State
                              Assembly instead of National Assembly). Errors can also occur at the
                              level of multi-word expressions (e.g., literal translation of Besedo
                              dajem to I give my word to instead of I give the floor to), or at the
                              utterance level, where we observed repetitions, additions, and
                              hallucinations, that is, MT output that is not related to the source
                              text. Therefore, it is crucial for any studies using translated
                              corpora to clearly outline the limitations of using machine-translated
                              content and to cross-check the findings with the source texts.”

                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-44">While both tools, noSketch Engine and TEITOK
                           support search, there are some important differences in the platforms
                           that can guide the users in choosing one over the other. As will be seen
                           in <ref target="#ch02">Part II</ref>, noSketch Engine is a powerful
                           analytical tool that can handle advanced search queries and can produce
                           different <ref target="#Statistical_measure">statistics</ref>. It enables
                           various data filtering approaches that can help the user refine the
                           results, save them (as subsets/subcorpora) and re-use them in subsequent
                           analyses either in the tool or locally. As such, it is great for
                           quantitative and qualitative research work over text. However, it is less
                           well adapted for viewing the annotated extended context which is
                           necessary for many interpretative tasks in qualitative research.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-45">While the results of search and statistical
                           queries in noSketch Engine allow the researcher to expand the text of the
                           proceedings, the range and display of the context is highly limited and
                           cannot be navigated in a transparent way. <hi rend="bold">So, noSketch
                              Engine is typically the tool for advanced querying and analysis while
                              TEITOK is the better choice when a clearer overview of context is
                              needed, i.e. it is able to present a corpus as a highly-annotated
                              digital edition. The two platforms are best understood as
                              complementary resources, particularly valuable for researchers working

                           data sources used, characteristics of the national parliament, etc. which
                           can be helpful for any users of this particular data in their study
                           designs and interpretation of the results (see, for example, <ref target="https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/teitok/parlamint-41/index.php?action=subselect&amp;id=UA"> the description page of the Ukrainian parliamentary corpus

                           Engine and it is advisable to check the TEITOK entry page for the
                           selected ParlaMint corpus even if the rest of the analysis is planned in
                           noSketch Engine. </p>

                           data obtained through a search query (e.g., for a particular word (at the
                           bottom of the results page in TEITOK), a user can list all parties with
                           information on how frequently they used this word; the search
                           functionality will be presented further down). However, these lists are
                           less informative compared to those produced in noSketch Engine which (1)
                           allow to display also <ref target="#Relative_frequency">relative
                              frequencies</ref> that are usually needed because the compared groups
                           are rarely of the same size, and (2) the lists in noSketch Engine provide
                           a direct link to display the actual speeches thus serving as a filtering
                           mechanism to get the most relevant data for the analysis. So, given a

                           it seems preferable to use noSketch Engine for any statistical tasks, and

                           help in the contextualisation of the results (see Figure 6 as an

                           syntax, it provides a query builder that facilitates query creation. As
                           with statistical analyses, it seems that noSketch Engine has a somewhat
                           easier and more powerful search interface than TEITOK. For this reason,
                           we introduce the TEITOK interface only insofar as it helps locate the
                           same section of a debate in both tools, thereby providing a more complete

                        particularly important for corpus compilers in order to represent the
                        internal structure of parliamentary proceedings in a consistent and
                        machine-readable way. By encoding sessions, debates, speakers, and
                        utterances, markup ensures that the corpus can be navigated, validated, and
                        maintained across different parliaments and languages. For users, such
                        structured markup is also highly valuable as it enables complex searches at

                        and their values that are filled with various information, like grammatical
                        characteristics or metadata about speeches and speakers. Certain tags are
                        constrained by closed typologies, e.g., speaker roles, political
                        orientation, linguistic labels, while other tags accept open or unrestricted
                        values, such as speaker names. A common schema like the one used in

                        (non-repetitive) vocabulary used in ParlaMint-PL is actually smaller than
                        the 320 thousand words just mentioned, since the <hi rend="italic">lemma</hi> element tells us that there are only around 90 thousand

                        include <hi rend="bold">a lowercased version of the textual content. This
                           means that all words which are otherwise written in uppercase letters,
                           are given a lowercase equivalent.</hi> This facilitates more consistent
                        searches, as users do not need to worry about differences in capitalisation
                        (e.g., the Polish lower house <hi rend="italic">Sejm </hi>vs. <hi rend="italic">sejm</hi>), and ensures that case variation does not cause
                        relevant results to be missed and at the same time avoid non-informative
                        repetitions in word <ref target="#Frequency_list">frequency lists</ref>. In
                        Figure 13 above we can see two elements that refer to lowercased versions,
                        namely <hi rend="italic">lc </hi>which stands for <hi rend="italic">lowercase word</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lemma_lc</hi> which stands for
                           <hi rend="italic">lowercase lemma</hi>. Figure 15 provides an example
                        sentence with annotations which show how the name <hi rend="italic">Andrzej</hi> (the original word) is lemmatised as <hi rend="italic">Andrzej, while the </hi>lowercased word and lemma equivalents are both
                           <hi rend="italic">andrzej. </hi>Note that the upper-case letters used at
                        the beginning of sentences are often, although not necessarily, lowercased
                        by default during lemmatisation, i.e. the process of ascribing lemmas to
                        words, which is why both the lemma and the lowercased lemma of the original
                        word <hi rend="italic">Głos</hi> is <hi rend="italic">głos.</hi>

                              consistently across the corpus (some errors are, however, always

                        these elements can be useful in queries since they allow the researcher to
                        search by a particular characteristic of a word/phrase rather than a list of
                        actual words/phrases, and therefore to obtain more comprehensible results.

                        few and generally well known, e.g., verb, noun, adjective, adverb …, <hi rend="italic">feats </hi>and <hi rend="italic">dep</hi> values are much
                        more numerous making it practically impossible to easily memorise all
                        different characteristics that they encode. For this reason, it is best to
                        always refer to the documentation of the tagset that was used in order to
                        interpret or find a specific label. </p>

                        be referred to by different labels across frameworks, and these labels are

                        for the use with ParlaMint data are (1) that it does not cover all ParlaMint
                        countries, (2) the data is available only up to 2019, while ParlaMint data
                        goes far beyond that point in time, and (3) not all parties included in
                        ParlaMint are represented in the CHES database. For this reason, it was
                        decided to add data from Wikipedia pages (and in very rare cases, also
                        annotations produced by corpus compilers) as the second layer of the
                        annotation of political orientation. Since the CHES database contains
                        numerical representations of political orientation and there was no
                        objective way to pair those with the categorial values used in Wikipedia,
                           <hi rend="bold">it was decided that only Wikipedia values will be

Such
                              speeches belong to speakers who themselves are tagged as belonging to
                              multiple parties (e.g., Tomenko, Mykola Volodymyrovyč –
                              Batkivshchyna;BPP). This is linked either to data processing errors or
                              to 1-day overlaps between parties when the person switched their
                              affiliation. </note> Their particularity lies in the fact that
                        these are fixed values collected from Wikipedia in 2022 and therefore do not
                        capture the potentially shifting political orientations of parties over
                        time, as the CHES dataset does. Moreover, the fact that the values were
                        collected in 2022 does not imply that they represent the parties’
                        orientations in that specific year (some parties had already been dissolved
                        by then), but simply that the information was harvested at that time. For
                        this kind of information, the user needs to consult the CHES values in the

                        First, samples were extracted from each ParlaMint dataset to enable
                        pre-training of the XLM-RoBERTa-large model on parliamentary discourse,
                        resulting in the BERT-like model XLM-R-Parla. Next, automatic annotation was
                        performed with a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model using a
                        prompt and adapted CAP topic definitions (see the Appendix in <ref target="https://github.com/clarinsi/ParlaMint-Annotation-with-CAP-Topics/blob/master/CAP_Conference_2025_Ljubesic_CAP_classification.pdf">Ljubešić et al., n.a</ref>.). Manual annotation of a test dataset was
                        conducted to evaluate the model’s output, confirming that its annotations
                        reached human-level quality (<ref target="https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3544814">Kuzman &amp;
                           Ljubešić, 2025</ref>). To improve topic coverage, infrequent instances
                        (e.g., for the <hi rend="italic">Public Lands</hi> topic) were added to the
                        training dataset, and the model was re-trained, leading to the improved

                        overall polarity. The decision is based on the overall meaning of the
                        sentence and the linguistic, rhetorical and typographical cues within the
                        sentence itself, such as polarity markers (<hi rend="italic">good,
                        bad</hi>), intensifiers (<hi rend="italic">enormous</hi>), diminutives,

                        surrounding sentences is not taken into account, so labels are assigned
                        independently of the broader discourse.</p>
                     <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-92">For this reason, the interpretation of sentiment
                        labels should be approached cautiously. A sentence-level label does not
                        necessarily indicate the attitude toward the sentence referents (since
                        multiple entities may appear in the same sentence), nor does it capture the
                        overall sentiment of an entire speech or debate (see also <ref target="#ch02.2">Showcase I</ref> and <ref target="#ch02.3">Showcase II</ref>). This is particularly relevant when formulating
                        research questions about political attitudes, where more targeted methods
                        looking only at the argumentation pertaining to a particular subject are
                        necessary.</p>
                     <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-93">Nevertheless, sentiment annotation remains useful
                        for other kinds of analysis. It can help trace broad shifts in tone over
                        time, compare variation in rhetorical style across speakers or parties, or
                        examine whether certain policy areas are typically framed in more positive
                        or negative terms. In this sense, sentiment tagging as realised in ParlaMint
                        is often more informative about how things are said, e.g. emotionally
                        charged vs. neutral style, than about what specific stance is taken toward
                        an issue.</p>

                        ParlaMint (Figure 25), they are encoded as a separate structure that can be
                        divided into up to two categories, namely <hi rend="italic">type </hi>(the
                        kind of action described) and <hi rend="italic">content </hi>(a
                        specification of that action), e.g., <hi rend="italic">vocal:murmuring:Murmures sur les bancs du groupe LR</hi>. When

                        it is important to keep in mind that the annotations are performed based on

                              of semantic tags, multi-value entries, e.g., <hi rend="italic">P1/S2</hi>, indicate multi-word expressions. However, note that
                              single entries can also refer to multi-word expressions, e.g., <hi rend="italic">world war</hi> when both parts are tagged with <hi rend="italic">Z2.</hi> On the other hand, when there are several
                              possible tags for a given unit, these are delimited by a comma in
                              noSketch Engine.</note> that are labelled with appropriate
                        semantic tags. The tagger matches the entries from the corpus with those in
                        the lexicon and maps the corresponding semantic tags. The user might come
                        across the following situations (Figure 32):</p>

                        judgments about the most appropriate semantic tag for a given word. For this
                        reason, users are expected to familiarise themselves with the underlying
                        taxonomy, i.e., set of possible categories, and adopt a flexible approach
                        when interpreting the labels. Semantic tags are best understood as tools for
                        gaining an initial overview of the data and identifying relevant samples for
                        qualitative analysis, rather than as definitive annotations in their own

                        which can be considered another form of semantic annotation. To make best
                        use of both layers, it is good to consider the following:</p>

                        <item>The two annotation layers differ in their schemas. <hi rend="bold">Semantic tagging relies on the USAS taxonomy</hi>, which comprises 21

                           annotation is based on the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema,
                           which is specifically designed to classify policy agendas and
                           parliamentary topics (Figure 23).</item>
                        <item>Although both annotations are automatic and rely on manually created
                           knowledge, they use different generations of computational models. <hi rend="bold">Semantic tagging is performed with </hi>

                           with a large multilingual transformer model. Specifically, it uses the
                           XLM-R-Parla model, a BERT-like model that has been additionally
                           pre-trained on parliamentary proceedings. The speeches were then
                           automatically classified into CAP categories using the GPT-4o model (see
                           Section <ref target="#ch01.4.2.13">

                     <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-108">Semantic tagging is sometimes used to extract the
                        topics of speeches, but given the schema used in ParlaMint, this is not the
                        most efficient application of this annotation layer – especially since a
                        dedicated topic-annotation layer already exists for the corpus. Instead, the
                        two layers should be seen as complementary. <hi rend="bold">Semantic tagging
                           provides a bottom-up perspective on how words are used (tags are assigned
                           at the word level), making it particularly valuable for linguistic and
                           discourse analysis. By contrast, topic annotation offers a top-down
                           perspective on what debates are about (tags are assigned at the speech
                           level), which is more suitable for political science research and related
                           fields.</hi>

                     <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-109">Together, they enable researchers to study not
                        only what parliaments talk about, but also how they talk about it. For
                        instance, semantic annotations can be used to analyse the use of emotional
                        language across debates or to track how economic vocabulary is distributed
                        over time and across the topics identified by the topic-annotation layer.
                        This, in turn, allows us to understand how much parliamentary attention is
                        devoted to areas such as healthcare or infrastructure, for example. Semantic
                        tags also make it possible to compare rhetorical styles, e.g., whether
                        debates rely more on emotional or technical vocabulary, to measure shifts in
                        framing, e.g., whether migration is discussed in terms of economy or
                        security, and to conduct cross-national comparisons, e.g., whether different
                        parliaments emphasise similar or different semantic domains when addressing
                        the same policy issue.</p>

                     annotations included in ParlaMint. We saw the diversity of information layered
                     on top of the original transcripts, and the comparability not only of the
                     underlying data but also of the added annotation layers. It is crucial to
                     understand that <hi rend="bold">data annotation produces more than just
                        descriptive labels. Instead, they are powerful research tools that allow
                        scholars to delimit searches, contextualise results, and refine
                        analyses</hi> in ways that directly shape findings. For example, excluding
                     chairpersons may be essential when investigating the framing of topical issues,
                     since their contributions often concern procedural matters; if the metadata
                     identifying chairpersons are absent, such a filter becomes impossible and the
                     results risk being skewed. All of this greatly extends the value of <hi rend="bold">ParlaMint as a data resource suitable for a wide range of
                        research questions – both within a single parliament and for comparative
                        work.</hi> However, when working with any part of the corpus – whether
                     original transcripts, translations, metadata, or linguistic annotations –
                     several considerations need to be kept in mind. Issues specific to the original
                     texts have already been discussed in Section <ref target="#ch01.2">Working with Parliamentary Corpora</ref>; the following paragraphs focus
                     instead on considerations related to machine translations and annotations.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-112">
                     <hi rend="bold">When using the machine-translated
                        versions of ParlaMint, researchers should be aware that these texts are
                        designed primarily to enable comparability across corpora rather than to
                        provide perfect linguistic fidelity.</hi> Machine translation may smooth
                     over idiomatic expressions, rhetorical nuance, or culturally specific
                     references, which can affect analyses that depend on fine-grained linguistic
                     detail (for some examples see Erjavec et al.). Semantic annotations are only
                     available for the translated corpora, which makes them valuable but also means
                     that any potential translation errors can propagate into the annotation layer.
                     It is therefore important that researchers explicitly acknowledge the use of
                     machine-translated data in their analyses and, where appropriate, cross-check
                     findings against the original texts, which are easily accessible in noSketch
                     Engine (see Section <ref target="#ch02.2.4.6.3">Analysing the keywords on
                        health</ref>). In this way, the translations are most reliable for
                     large-scale, comparative analyses of meaning, but should be used with caution
                     in studies requiring close linguistic or stylistic interpretation.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-113">Regarding the metadata, despite extensive efforts to
                     produce comparable corpora, <hi rend="bold">limitations in available data and
                        national political traditions mean that some metadata fields may be
                        systematically missing or inconsistently populated</hi> – for instance, the
                     birth-year field is empty in ParlaMint-GB, but not in ParlaMint-SI. It is
                     therefore essential to check each corpus you plan to use before you finalise
                     your study plan: what is present, what is missing, and how evenly fields are
                     populated.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-114">Moreover, <hi rend="bold">any annotation campaign
                        requires decisions about logistical setup (e.g., number of annotators,
                        annotations per item, annotator training) and the annotation schema. The
                        schema substantially influences outcomes and the usefulness of the
                        annotations for different user communities.</hi> No taxonomy will be ideal
                     for all research questions. By understanding both the procedure and the schema
                     used, it becomes easier to leverage the considerable work already invested in
                     annotation and to find ways to reuse or adapt the data for one’s purposes.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-115">In ParlaMint, metadata categories follow shared
                     taxonomies designed to reflect available source data and ensure comparability
                     across corpora – one of the collection’s main advantages. This does not mean
                     they should be accepted uncritically or applied uniformly across studies, nor
                     discarded at the first sign of mismatch with the framework the researcher has
                     in mind. For some projects, categories, used in ParlaMint, may be too broad to
                     capture important distinctions, for others, too narrow. In such cases, it is
                     advisable to treat the annotations as a starting point: to help filter the
                     data, to be used for triangulation with other annotations, to reinterpret them
                     in light of a selected analytical framework. It is always possible to set them
                     aside altogether and focus just on the original texts. A case in point are
                     political orientation metadata: the broad categories used in ParlaMint may not
                     capture the nuances required for fine-grained studies of the far right in
                     political science, yet they remain valuable for more broadly designed analyses
                     of party landscape or as the first data filter. The key is to approach metadata
                     critically and reflexively, in connection with the adopted research questions
                     and theoretical assumptions.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-116">Finally, <hi rend="bold">it is important to
                        understand how the metadata and annotations were produced</hi>.
                     Sociodemographic information in ParlaMint was typically drawn from official
                     parliamentary records and can generally be trusted, aside from occasional
                     clerical errors. In other cases, such as political orientation, expert sources
                     or triangulated records were used to fill gaps. In other cases, automatic
                     models trained and/or evaluated on expert annotations, such as those used for
                     sentiment and topic annotation, were applied to generate high-confidence
                        predictions.<hi rend="bold"> Each of these methods carries implications for
                        reliability and for the kinds of questions that can be answered with the
                        available tags.</hi> Inevitably, some errors persist, whether due to
                     inaccuracies in source data, misclassifications by predictive models, or
                     processing issues. Although multiple mitigation measures were implemented in
                     ParlaMint, like systematic error checking and the use of high-accuracy models,
                     no dataset is error-free, but rather than dismissing the metadata, researchers
                     should just approach them with due vigilance and try making the most out of the
                     data.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-116a">In addition to these corpus‑level considerations, it is also important to
                     recognise the <hi rend="bold">inherent limitations of the traditional corpus analytical methods</hi>
                     available in noSketch Engine and TEITOK. Measures such as keyword lists,
                     collocations or frequency comparisons can be highly informative, yet they are
                     sensitive to factors such as reference corpus choice, tokenisation differences,
                     and the statistical thresholds applied. Keywords, in particular, are only
                     indicators of potential salience and may be misleading without close contextual
                     reading. Similarly, collocates can foreground patterns that reflect
                     methodological choices – such as window size or association measures – rather
                     than underlying linguistic behaviour. These methods therefore work best when
                     combined with careful interpretation, iterative checking, and an awareness of
                     how tool settings shape the results.</p>

               relate to the gender of MPs, demonstrating how frequency measures, topic tags and
               keyword analysis can be combined to explore patterns while remaining attentive to
               contextual and methodological limitations. The second showcase introduces sentiment
               analysis in parliamentary discourse, showing how sentence‑level sentiment annotations
               can be used to investigate variation over time and across political parties, and how

               <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-122">Research on parliamentary activity shows that women and
                  men differ not only in terms of their numbers and positions within legislatures,
                  but also in the kinds of topics they engage with. While recurring patterns suggest
                  that debates may appear to be structured along gendered lines, these should not be
                  interpreted as straightforward gender-based differences. Instead, they result from
                  the interplay of multiple intersecting parameters such as age, ethnicity, party
                  affiliation, length of incumbency, and seniority. Moreover, citizens often expect
                  women MPs to focus on issues linked to traditional female roles, such as family
                  policy, social welfare, healthcare, or domestic violence. By contrast, areas such
                  as finance, security, or technological development are more often associated with
                  men and often regarded as more prestigious, reflecting historically masculine
                  social roles (<ref target="#Chaques-Bonafont_2022">Chaqués‐Bonafont &amp; Cristancho 2022</ref>; <ref target="#Fiser_2021">Fišer &amp; Pahor de Maiti

                     could also be performed on the version that aggregates all ParlaMint corpora in
                     their original languages (ParlaMint-XX), we will use the English-translated
                     version of ParlaMint to facilitate the linguistic interpretation of
                     subtopics.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-127">Moreover, we will filter the data by gender as well
                     as the status and role of speakers. In practice, this means including only MPs
                     who participated as regular speakers, while excluding guests – a heterogeneous
                     group that might comprise both elected figures (such as national presidents,
                     foreign presidents, and MPs from other parliaments) and non‑elected actors
                     (including political appointees and civil activists), as well as chairpersons
                     whose interventions are largely procedural, although this may vary from one
                     parliament to another. This decision is important because MPs are the elected
                     representatives, and their contributions constitute the core of parliamentary
                     debate and policymaking, whereas interventions from external actors or chairs
                     serve different functions and are therefore not directly comparable.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-128">Restricting the dataset in this way ensures that the
                     observed patterns reflect the substantive participation of legislators rather
                     than being skewed by formulaic or non-substantive speech. This delimitation is
                     especially relevant for the second part of the analysis addressing the subtopic
                     exploration, where we move beyond the pre-assigned topic tags and rely instead
                     on the semantics of the vocabulary itself. In such analyses, the procedural
                     language of chairpersons or the occasional contributions of guests could
                     disproportionately influence keyword extraction or topic modelling, making it
                     harder to categorise vocabulary by topic and obscuring the activity of elected
                     representatives, which is our primary focus in this showcase.</p>

                        under scrutiny. The frequencies reflect the absolute number of tokens that
                        compose the speeches addressing a given topic. Topics circled in Figure 40
                        indicate the ones that <ref target="#Ljubesic_n.d.">Ljubešić et al. (n.a.)</ref>, in line with previous
                        studies, identified as being more frequently debated by one of the gendered
                        groups, namely <hi rend="italic">health, civil rights, education and social
                           welfare </hi>for women (red circles)<hi rend="italic">, </hi>and <hi rend="italic">macroeconomics, transportation, defence </hi>and <hi rend="italic">energy</hi> for men (blue circles).</p>
                     <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-145">A quick glance at Figure 40 reveals that topics
                        typically associated with women’s speeches (red circles) indeed appear
                        higher in the ranking of the regularMP_F subcorpus than in regularMP_M.
                        Likewise, the highest-ranked topic in the regularMP_M subcorpus
                        (macroeconomics) corresponds to one of the domains most often identified as
                        male-dominated in previous research. This corroborates earlier findings and
                        hints at particular gendered patterns in parliamentary discourse.</p>
                     <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-146">However, topic ordering alone cannot reliably
                        point to gender differences or similarities. Based on our results, one might
                        even argue that the two distributions appear broadly similar: most of the
                        highly ranked topics, e.g., law and crime, international affairs, education,
                        occur frequently in both corpora, albeit in slightly different positions.
                        The challenge lies in the fact that the two subcorpora differ substantially
                        in size (see <ref target="#ch02.2.4.1">
                           <hi rend="italic">Step
                              I</hi>
                        </ref>). Without <ref target="#Normalisation_or_frequency_normalisation">normalisation</ref>, any comparison risks overestimating the prominence of
                        certain topics in the larger corpus while underestimating it in the smaller
                        one.</p>
                     <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-147">Normalisation is achieved by calculating relative
                        frequencies, which makes it possible to assess not only whether women and
                        men debate the same themes (which is expected since this depends on the
                        session agenda), but also whether they devote proportionally more or less
                        attention to specific areas. For instance, observation based on absolute
                        frequency values, according to which topics are ranked in Figure 40,
                        suggests that <hi rend="italic">health </hi>and <hi rend="italic">social
                           welfare</hi> occupy a relatively stronger position in women’s speeches
                        than in men’s, while <hi rend="italic">macroeconomics </hi>and <hi rend="italic">defence</hi> are more salient in men’s discourse. The next
                        step in the interpretation of the results is therefore to adjust for corpus
                        size and examine whether proportional frequencies confirm the patterns
                        observed based on the absolute counts.</p>

                        counts do not fully translate when relative frequencies are taken into
                        account. Consider, for example, the first two topics in the listing above
                        (Figure 40) that are shared between the two subcorpora: <hi rend="italic">Health </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Macroeconomics</hi>. In absolute
                        terms, <hi rend="italic">Health </hi>is more frequently represented in the
                           <hi rend="italic">regularMP_M</hi> subcorpus than in <hi rend="italic">regularMP_F</hi> (50 million tokens vs. 32 million tokens,
                        respectively). This might lead to a quick but misleading conclusion that
                        health is a more dominant topic for men than for women. However, relative
                        frequencies reveal the opposite: women address health almost twice as often
                        as men. By contrast, <hi rend="italic">Macroeconomics </hi>is clearly very
                        prominent in the <hi rend="italic">regularMP_M</hi> subcorpus and much less
                        so in <hi rend="italic">regularMP_F</hi>. Relative frequencies confirm this
                        trend, showing that macroeconomic issues are discussed nearly 1.5 times more
                        often in men’s speeches. Yet the absolute counts also show that, despite
                        this difference, <hi rend="italic">Macroeconomics </hi>remains a major theme
                        in the regularMP_F subcorpus, ranking second overall.</p>

                        frequencies uncover how strongly each gendered group emphasises a given
                        issue compared to the other group. Taken together, they provide a more
                        nuanced view: women clearly privilege topics such as health and social
                        welfare, while men devote proportionally greater attention to
                        macroeconomics, defence, and government operations. At the same time,
                        overlap in high-ranking topics across both groups reminds us that gendered
                        differences occur within a largely shared parliamentary agenda.</p>

                        reveal distinct gendered approaches to these issues. Our second research
                        question, which we tackle in the next steps, addresses exactly this

                           <p style="text-align:justify">noSketch Engine enables different types of searches, from simple to
                           advanced. The interface allows to formulate search queries that combine
                           tokens, different levels of linguistic tags and metadata. The search
                           option that allows most complex queries is called CQL which uses a
                           particular syntax and requires a bit of getting-used-to.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn28" n="28">To

                           help the user formulate the CQL query, like the CQL builder available in

                     <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-155">Now that we have created the necessary
                        subcorpora, we can proceed to creating keywords lists which will show us the
                        typical vocabulary of the focus group in comparison to the reference group.
                        The calculation is based on <ref target="https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/simple-maths/">
                           <hi rend="italic">simple math</hi>
                        </ref> and basically leverages relative
                        frequencies to determine which items are comparatively more frequent in the
                        focus corpus. The result is the keyness score which can be displayed via <hi rend="italic">Change view settings</hi> and is, by default, used to sort
                        the keywords. The keywords can be actual tokens, but can also be different
                        tags. In this step, we will exploit both options. First, we will use
                        semantic annotations, available in the machine-translated ParlaMint, to
                        compute the typical semantic domains used by men and women MPs in speeches
                        on macroeconomics. Next, we will take another approach and produce a list of
                        typical lemmas used by men and women MPs in speeches on health.</p>

                           which requires some preliminary clarification before moving on to
                           interpretation. The lists can be more or less “messy.” This is especially
                           true for the machine-translated version, which contains typical
                           translation errors (see <ref target="#q2ienafwieft">Footnote<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>
                                 </ref>). The keyword method itself also
                           adds to this messiness, as it tends to highlight anomalies or features
                           that are particularly distinctive compared to the reference subcorpus.
                           Another layer of complexity in interpreting these lists is the importance
                           of context: while a researcher is usually familiar with the political and
                           social background of the country they are analysing, it is much harder to
                           remain fully aware of all the local political issues, debates, and actors
                           that may surface in the keywords of several parliaments, as is our case.
                           By contrast, keyword lists derived from original-language data are
                           usually much clearer. For instance, see the two keyword lists from the
                           British corpus in Figure 53 below.</p>

                              <p style="text-align:justify">Although the lists we obtain are less
                           straightforward to interpret than those derived directly from the
                           ParlaMint corpora in the original languages (due to translation errors
                           and limited contextual information) they can still be analytically useful
                           if approached with appropriate mitigation strategies. Such strategies may
                           include disregarding obvious translation mistakes or restricting the
                           analysis to common nouns only.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">To minimise the analytical challenges posed by
                           insufficient knowledge of the local context across 29 parliaments, and to
                           facilitate content analysis aimed at subtopic identification, we adopt
                           the latter strategy and exclude proper nouns from our analysis. One way
                           to achieve this is to disregard all lemmas that begin with or are written
                           entirely in capital letters. While this could be done manually, we make
                           use of a shortcut available in noSketch Engine:</p>

                        this showcase, in line with our second research question, we focus on the
                        comparison of subtopics addressed in speeches on a common central topic,
                        i.e. <hi rend="italic">Macroeconomics </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Health</hi>. To this end, we first analyse the common and unique semantic
                        domains present on lists of speeches by women and men respectively and then
                        perform close reading of a random sample of 20 concordances for each of the
                        first 50 key semantic domains to establish the prevailing topic
                        patterns.</p>

                        rather than fixed parameters. They are set to keep the qualitative
                        inspection manageable while still covering the main semantic patterns that
                        characterise the corpus. These thresholds can be adjusted depending on the
                        research goals, corpus size, and how much manual work is feasible. You can
                        also base your selection on keyness scores instead of just taking the top N
                        keywords, but there’s no universal rule for what counts as a “good” score –
                        it depends on your corpus and research questions.</p>

                           topics and relational aspects more than men who tend to focus more on
                           technical domains and are more process-oriented in their speeches.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-167">The analysis of key semantic domains in
                           speeches on <hi rend="italic">Macroeconomics </hi>shows that both women
                           and men MPs address this topic, largely as a result of the parliamentary
                           agenda, but their emphases differ. By identifying domains that are
                           exclusive to one group, for example, <hi rend="italic">Health and
                              disease</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Residence </hi>for women, and <hi rend="italic">Competition </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Industry </hi>for
                           men, we see a clear divergence. Women’s speeches foreground the social
                           dimension of economic management, drawing attention to welfare-state
                           concerns and everyday-life issues ranging from child benefits to
                           pensions. Men’s speeches, by contrast, more often employ domains
                           associated with market governance, monetary policy, and business
                           structures.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-168">Because semantic tags alone do not always
                           yield fully transparent interpretations, it is important to contextualise
                           results to avoid bias. To this end, we examined a random sample of
                           concordances and assigned each key semantic domain a predominant thematic
                           orientation: <hi rend="italic">technical, social</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">other</hi>. This additional layer of analysis,
                           illustrated in Table 5 and Table 6, reinforces the initial observations:
                           men’s discourse tends to be more technical in character than women’s,
                           e.g., <hi rend="italic">You know that metallurgy has started to rise a
                              little bit, but there's no demand for metal in the internal market
                              …</hi>). This is not to say, however, that the social aspect is not
                           fully absent as shown by this illustrative example: <hi rend="italic">Inflation is a hidden tax, which is the tax of the little man.</hi>
                           On the other hand, women’s discourse more frequently foregrounds
                           relational and social aspects, e.g., <hi rend="italic">it has to do with
                              both youth work and a lot of other preventive work; the rate of female
                              participation in work is really very low; a welfare state that
                              protects us and that allows citizens to continue to
                           progress</hi>).</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-169">Semantic tags can also be useful for
                           identifying rhetorical characteristics in parliamentary discourse.
                           Certain semantic domains do not point to thematic content but to
                           stylistic features of speech, for example, special forms of address
                           (e.g., <hi rend="italic">congresswoman</hi>), evaluative labels (e.g.,
                              <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>), or appeals to authority (e.g., Bible
                           references). Such domains appear in both corpora, but they occur more
                           frequently, and thus seem more typical, in the men’s subcorpus. Already
                           within the first ten key domains, three can be identified as primarily
                           expressive rather than thematic.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-170">Likewise, some semantic domains capture
                           vocabulary that is used metaphorically rather than to reference concrete
                           entities. These instances show why close reading is essential: without
                           context, semantic tags may be misread as pointing to concrete themes,
                           when in fact they signal figurative usage. For example:</p>

                           an iterative process of moving back and forth between the concordance
                           lines. Close reading enabled the identification of recurrent thematic
                           clusters that capture distinct and context-specific ways in which Members
                           of Parliament discuss health-related issues. Such an approach typically
                           involves an open-ended coding schema, where categories are added,
                           refined, or merged as new patterns emerge. The concordance lines are
                           therefore examined multiple times, allowing the researcher to adjust the
                           tags in light of an expanded and more nuanced interpretative framework.
                           The categories thus reflect data-driven thematic orientations within the
                           corpus rather than a priori classifications from existing typologies.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-176">The analysis, of which an excerpt from the
                           results is presented in Table 7 and Table 8, shows that women tend to
                           focus on different subtopics than men when debating <hi rend="italic">Health</hi>. While the method of keywords is biased towards finding
                           differences given that it outputs a list of typical words of one
                           subcorpus in relation to the other subcorpus, what is crucial are the
                           actual thematic areas that each of the gendered groups covered in the
                           debates. The fact that women and not men MPs address the topics
                           traditionally associated with women, as shown in the example below,
                           demonstrates that they indeed contribute an important part in the
                           representation of the so-called women’s issues.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-177">Women MPs most often highlight
                           patient-centered perspectives, focusing on gynecological and reproductive
                           health, e.g., <hi rend="italic">contraception</hi>, <hi rend="italic">menopause</hi>, <hi rend="italic">mammography</hi>, chronic and
                           psychosocial conditions, e.g.,<hi rend="italic">coeliac</hi>, <hi rend="italic">anorexia</hi>, and the accessibility of care. Men MPs,
                           by contrast, address health more indirectly through ideological and
                           structural dimensions, e.g., <hi rend="italic">anti-vaccination,
                              homeopathy</hi>, or budgetary and institutional aspects of health
                           policy, e.g., <hi rend="italic">forint, EEAS</hi>. They are also much
                           more likely to frame health with ideological or symbolic language,
                           invoking terms such as <hi rend="italic">martyrs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">capitalist</hi>, that situate health debates within
                           broader political struggles. This contrast shows that, while both women
                           and men MPs address health in line with the parliamentary agenda, their
                           emphases diverge: women draw attention to issues that might otherwise
                           remain invisible, such as the specific needs of female patients
                           highlighted in the example below.</p>

                              women's health, which no one has mentioned so far. Because there is a
                              need for more knowledge about diseases affecting women more often than
                              men. Some of these diseases have been exacerbated during the pandemic,
                              such as eating disorders, especially in young girls. But we also have
                              women who are more often affected by rheumatic disorders and multiple
                              sclerosis. There are women who get heart attacks, but have symptoms
                              other than men, and we need to know more about that.</hi>”

                           annotations such as semantic tags can help scale up the analysis and
                           reveal patterns that would otherwise remain hidden, yet they also carry
                           the risk of misleading analysts into drawing overly hasty conclusions.
                           This is why contextualisation remains essential, and we have seen several
                           ways to optimise it – through sorting, filtering keyword lists, returning
                           to original data, and using random sampling.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-179">Moreover, each method requires a solid
                           understanding of its underlying principles in order to avoid
                           misinterpretation – for example, applying relative frequencies when
                           comparing subcorpora of different sizes, or focusing on the types of
                           differences rather than simply their existence when interpreting keyword
                           results. In this way, we can use these methods both safely and
                           efficiently to interpret discourse patterns and to understand how
                           different groups of MPs (not only gendered ones) contribute to shaping
                           parliamentary debate or indeed any other form of communication
                           represented in a corpus.</p>

               <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-180">Sentiment analysis focuses on identifying the attitudes
                  or opinions people express toward a specific entity. Introduced as a natural
                  language processing task nearly twenty years ago, it has since evolved
                  considerably. However, despite the latest advancements in computational
                  linguistics, the empirical applications of sentiment analysis in political science
                  are not very widespread. First, they are commonly limited to the English-speaking
                  world, while analysing political discourse in low-resourced languages can pose
                  problems due to the lack of ready-made tools. Second, predominant approaches to
                  sentiment analysis in political science such as dictionary-based sentiment
                  extraction, i.e. using a predefined lexicon marked with positive, negative or
                  neutral connotation and counting or weighing the occurrences of these words in a
                  unit of analysis, produce less accurate results, while the usage of large language
                  models is time- and cost-inefficient.</p>
               <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-181">The approach to sentiment analysis adopted in ParlaMint
                  5.0 addresses both challenges by pre-training the multilingual transformer model
                  on the domain-specific training parliamentary datasets from a selected group of
                  languages and then running it on other languages in the ParlaMint corpora without
                  additional fine-tuning. The resulting 3-level, 6-level and raw numerical sentiment
                  annotation available via the noSketch Engine concordancer opens multiple
                  possibilities for exploring and comparing sentiment patterns in parliamentary
                  speech as well as observing them in combination with other types of annotation in
                  the ParlaMint corpora. For details on how sentiment is annotated in the ParlaMint
                  corpora, please see <ref target="#ch01.4.2.14">Sentiment information</ref> above. </p>

                  <ref target="#Ljubesic_2025">Ljubešić et. al. (2025)</ref> measured the emotional
                  colouring of sentences in 26 national and 3 regional parliaments in Europe across
                  the 21 policy topics specified in ParlaMint. They concluded that most European
                  parliaments employ predominantly negative rhetoric across policy areas, which is
                  reflected in the prevalence of blue in Figure 61. Topic-level patterns are also
                  visible. Cultural debates are the most positive, likely because they are often
                  celebratory and unifying, whereas discussions of Law and Crime are consistently
                  negative, reflecting their focus on problems such as criminal behaviour and
                  punishment. Country-wise, the United Kingdom, Latvia and Serbia stand out with a
                  more positive tone across topics, while debates in the Portuguese, Estonian or
                  Greek parliaments appear to be more negative compared to other European
                  countries.</p>

                     fact, the steps taken here could also be applied to any other ParlaMint corpus

                     ParlaMint (ParlaMint-XX-en). However, care should be taken when interpreting
                     results based on machine‑translated texts, as translation errors or subtle
                     shifts in meaning may affect the analysis. It is equally important to recognise
                     the risk of misinterpreting sentiment related to specific concepts across
                     parliamentary parties and groups, if one does not account for varying
                     linguistic patterns and rhetorical traditions on the one hand, and party
                     agendas and national contexts on the other. You can mitigate these risks by
                     combining linguistic analysis with contextual political knowledge of the

                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-190">This showcase follows five basic steps, integrating
                     quantitative and qualitative methods to lead you from broad observations to a
                     contextualised interpretation of the data. However, it is worth noting that
                     corpus-assisted research in SSH is often non-linear, as the retrieved data may
                     prompt adjustments to the operationalisation of units of inquiry, units of
                     analysis, or even the research question itself. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-191">To seek answers to RQ2.1 and RQ2.2, we need to
                     operationalise them for the purposes of automatic retrieval of the concordance
                     lines referring to the European Union before and after Brexit. There are three
                     considerations to keep in mind. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-192">First, the European Union can be explicitly referred
                     to either as the phrase <hi rend="italic">European Union</hi> or as the
                     abbreviation <hi rend="italic">EU</hi>. We should also bear in mind that it is
                     not uncommon for politicians, MPs included, to converge the concepts of the EU
                     and Europe in their speech, drawing on the polysemous nature of the word <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>. For further discussion of how these concepts
                     converge and diverge in political discourse, see, e.g., Krzyżanowski (2010:
                     99-131). </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-193">Second, because the UK officially withdrew from the
                     EU on 31 January 2020 – just one day after the World Health Organization (WHO)
                     declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern – we can
                     use the <ref target="#ch01.4.2.12">integrated subcorpora</ref> to make the
                     desired longitudinal comparison, since ParlaMint-GB contains no speeches dated
                     31 January 2020. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-194">Third, as in the <ref target="#ch02.2.2">research procedure for Showcase I</ref>, we will again restrict our search
                     to utterances by MPs only, excluding guests and chairpersons.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="caution">
                     <hi rend="bold">Caution!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-196">Before we proceed any further, it needs to be
                     emphasised that sentences containing any of the search nodes (EU, European
                     Union, Europe) and annotated as “Negative”, “Neutral” or “Positive”, do not
                     necessarily express the negative, neutral or positive attitude of the speaker
                     toward the EU/European Union/Europe! In ParlaMint corpora, sentiment is
                     annotated at the sentence level, while our focus in this showcase is on
                     patterns of use at the word/phrase level. Therefore, the quantitative results
                     we are about to obtain must be interpreted with <hi rend="bold">caution,</hi>
                     and it is strongly advised to closely read selected concordance lines from the
                     searches and apply qualitative analysis for their explanation, which will be an
                     integral part of your research methodology. </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-204">In answering RQ2.1, the numerical data
                           obtained thus far indicate that, after Brexit, references to the EU occur
                           far less frequently in ParlaMint-GB. Although such references continue to
                           appear characteristically in neutral contexts, there is a moderate shift
                           towards their occurrence in sentences annotated as negative. As with the
                           EU, mentions of Europe also decline sharply after Brexit across all
                           sentiment categories, suggesting a general reduction in Europe‑related
                           discourse in the UK Parliament. Unlike the EU, however, Europe tends to
                           be used in more evaluative (non-neutral) contexts and displays a more
                           pronounced shift towards negative density in the post‑Brexit period. </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-205">That said, further interpretation and
                           explanation of these results require the use of additional techniques of
                           both distant and close reading, together with a critical evaluation of
                           the broader sociopolitical context. For instance, negative sentences
                           mentioning Europe may relate to the Covid‑19 pandemic or to Russia’s war
                           of aggression against Ukraine, as illustrated in the examples below: </p>

                        directed at the EU as an institution and those directed at specific events,
                        such as Brexit. Without this qualitative step, quantitative sentiment ratios

                           these instances are more emphatically negative than sentences annotated
                           within the 0–5 range and therefore offer a promising starting point for

                           consequences of Brexit for Scotland. In these examples, the EU is framed
                           as a guarantor of rights and quality, and its absence is associated with
                           tangible harm to Scottish interests. </p>

                           adopt a more critical and confrontational tone towards the EU. Their
                           references include accusations of inflexibility, manipulation of trade
                           protocols, and economic inefficiency. The EU is portrayed as obstructive
                           or adversarial, with the wording such as “conning,” “imposing a border,”
                           and “threat to disrupt exports”, and its representatives as irritable and
                           overreacting, “as if they had been stung by wasps”. Although some lines
                           acknowledge the need for continued negotiation, the overall sentiment
                           leans towards scepticism and strategic distancing. Conservative speakers
                           also take the opportunity to criticise the Scottish Government for

                           comparing the collocate lists in Figure 85 and Figure 86 above, is the
                           polar difference in sentiment related to the lemma <hi rend="italic">rejoin</hi>. It emerges as the strongest collocate of the <hi rend="italic">EU/European Union </hi>in positively annotated sentences
                           uttered by SNP members and in negatively annotated sentences uttered by

                           clarify this difference in sentiment. While SNP members discuss rejoining
                           the EU as a desired scenario for Scotland (Figure 87), Conservative MPs
                           criticise predominantly the SNP, but also members of some other
                           parliamentary parties, for expressing a desire to rejoin the EU (Figure
                           88). </p>

                           reveals a recurring narrative of involuntary separation (Figure 89). The
                           patterns “dragged out of” in the left-hand contexts and “against … will /
                           wishes” in the right-hand contexts appear repeatedly, emphasising
                           Scotland’s lack of agency and the perceived violation of its electoral
                           mandate. This framing casts Brexit not as a collective national decision
                           but as an imposed rupture, often linked to economic harm, political
                           betrayal, and cultural loss. The collocate <hi rend="italic">drag</hi>
                           thus functions as a rhetorical anchor for grievance, reinforcing the
                           SNP’s broader argument for autonomy and re-engagement with the EU.</p>

                           positive emotional stance (<hi rend="italic">proud, delighted,
                              confident</hi>), positive evaluation (<hi rend="italic">excellent,
                              quality</hi>), intensifiers (<hi rend="italic">really</hi>), lexis
                           associated with goals, progress, or future‑oriented positivity (<hi rend="italic">ambitious, ambition, vision, pursue, chance</hi>),
                           expressions of centrality (<hi rend="italic">at the heart of</hi>), as
                           well as items indicating economic development (<hi rend="italic">freeports</hi>), improvement, strengthening, or proactive engagement
                              (<hi rend="italic">boost, engage, attract</hi>). </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-229">By contrast, the keyword list representing the
                           mixed-positive_… subcorpus is dominated by items related to governance,
                           law, regulation, and institutional processes (<hi rend="italic">regulations, court, responsibility, appropriate, guarantee, function,
                              political, SI, i.e. Statutory Instrument</hi>), along with lexis
                           referring to specific policy areas (<hi rend="italic">emission, vehicle,
                              excise</hi>) as well as other common words and proper nouns that are
                           predominantly neutral. </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify" xml:id="DispatchBox-p-230">Taken together, the two keyword lists reveal a
                           palpable distinction in how positive sentiment is constructed across the
                           two subcorpora. The positive_… subcorpus relies heavily on explicitly
                           affective and evaluative lexis, including emotional adjectives and
                           aspirational vocabulary, alongside policy‑linked terms framed as
                           opportunities. By contrast, the mixed‑positive_… subcorpus is dominated
                           by governance‑, regulation‑, and institution‑related terminology,
                           supplemented by technical policy‑domain items and largely neutral
                           procedural vocabulary. This suggests that positive sentiment in the
                           positive_… subcorpus is conveyed primarily through overtly positive
                           lexical choices, whereas in the mixed‑positive_… subcorpus it emerges
                           more subtly from contextual framing within otherwise neutral or
                           administrative language.</p>

                           challenges and opportunities of applying sentence-level sentiment
                           annotations to word-level expressions in parliamentary discourse. By
                           tracing sentiment variation over time and across party lines in debates
                           concerning the European Union, we have highlighted the importance of
                           aligning linguistic granularity with analytical aims. While quantitative
                           data and corpus techniques such as collocation analysis, keyword analysis
                           and concordance reading offer valuable insights into political
                           polarisation, they must be contextualised within broader rhetorical and
                           ideological frameworks to avoid misinterpretation. As with all
                           corpus-assisted research, methodological rigour and political awareness
                           are essential to ensure that sentiment analysis contributes meaningfully
                           to our understanding of parliamentary language and its evolving
                           dynamics.</p>

                  <gloss>is a word or phrase that identifies a specific real-world object. Most
                     often, it includes the categories of a person, organisation, location and other
                     named objects (like document names). In corpus linguistics and natural language
                     processing, named entities are determined via a procedure called NER – <hi rend="italic">named entity recognition</hi>. It refers to the automatic
                     identification and classification of such expressions in text, e.g.,
                     recognising “United Nations” as an organisation or “Paris” as a

                     text type. Values below 100% indicate that the item is less typical of that
                     text type; values around 100% indicate equal typicality; and values above 100%
